# Lab Inventory Management System

## Introduction

Our project encompasses a comprehensive Lab Inventory Database designed to address the challenges researchers face in managing laboratory supplies and equipment. It focuses on tracking, organizing, and maintaining the stock of chemicals and equipment used in laboratory operations.

Furthermore, this database-driven application efficiently manages and analyzes purchase, vendor, and current stock data. It seamlessly connects Purchase and Current Stock data, enabling effortless identification of items purchased from specific vendors. Users can evaluate vendor performance by counting purchases and identify those with significant purchase volumes. The application supports advanced analysis through nested aggregation, displaying items with quantities below the average. Additionally, it streamlines the tracking of purchase dates from all vendors.
